Current health monitoring approaches frequently rely on fixed, predetermined benchmarks to classify patient health conditions. However, these rigid criteria often fail to account for the 
subtle differences among diverse patient groups. This limitation can result in overly simplistic evaluations and may miss important, nuanced patterns within health data.
The key challenge lies in creating a more flexible and adaptive system. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we can discover natural clusters within health data that 
aren't constrained by preconceived categories. This data-driven approach has the potential to enable more individualized and accurate health management strategies, tailored to 
the unique characteristics of each patient group.
